    Create new features
    Test feature scaling approaches

Missing Data Imputation
    The current imputation strategy is to use KNN imputation with 7 neighbors
    Other methods tested:
        Mean Imputation
        Median Imputation
        Fill With Zeros
        Omit
    Methods to try:
        MICE
        Miss-Forest

High Performer Imputation
    The current method uses ADA Boosted Decision Tree classification with the following feature types excluded
        SJMostScores, SJLeastScores, SJTimes, ScenarioScores
    Other methods tested:
        GLM Net
        Gradient Boosted Decision Trees
        Random Forest

Feature Generation / scoring
    Current Features
        Scenarios scored based on their distance away from the most common answer (0 is best score, linear scoring)
            Could approach this in a exponential fashion instead
        Situational judgement scored as 1 if best answer is given, -1 if worse answer is given and 0 otherwise
            Normalize response by probability and score based on the probability of the response
            Look at the popularity of the answer in just the "Hired" dataset to determine the correct response
        Biology use the values found in the base data
        Personality scales area created in two steps
            Reverse the orientation of any negative sub-scales
            Combine sub-scales into a single score for each personality scale
        Time features use the values found in the base data
    Features to Test
        Non-linear (Quadratic?) relationship between performance and retention
            Full pop
            Protected vs Non-Protected
            Test using situational judgement data / scenario data
        Use dimensionality reduction on the personality data (start with 13 scale scores) (down to 5)
        Log transform time?
