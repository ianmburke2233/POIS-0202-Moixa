Feature Generation / scoring
    Scenarios scored based on their distance away from the most common answer (0 is best score, linear scoring)
    Situational judgement scored as 1 if best answer is given, -1 if worse answer is given and 0 otherwise
    Biology use the values found in the base data
    Personality scales area created in two steps
        Reverse the orientation of any negative sub-scales
        Combine sub-scales into a single score for each personality scale
    Time features use the values found in the base data
